## 2.2 Applications of C++
- **System Programming**: Writing system programs like operating systems, compilers, and interpreters.
- **Game Development**: Creating games using libraries such as SDL or OpenGL.
- **Web Development**: Using languages like PHP to create dynamic web pages.
- **Embedded Systems Programming**: Designing hardware for specialized applications (e.g., automotive control units)
- **Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning**: Implementing AI algorithms in software. 

## 2.3 A Simple C++ program

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{

    cout << "cout object is used to display the result or any other information on the screen, it takes * parameters which can be passed into it for displaying purpose." << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This is a simple C++ program that includes the necessary header file `<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes all standard library headers. The `main()` function serves as the entry point for 
the program. It returns an integer value (usually `0`) indicating successful execution.</s>
